0. General Notes/Contact

nohttpd binds to port 80, a priviledged port on all OS. Therefore nohttpd must be run with Administrator/root
privileges. Please see http://www.cdhk.de/buck/nohttpd/ for some discussion on that topic.

If you had problems compiling nohttpd (and perhaps even were able to fix them), found a bug, have a feature
request/general comment or just want to say thank you, feel free to mail to <c.buck{at)gmx.de> (Note: Replace
"{at)" with "@").

Compiling on all OS requires wxWidgets (http://www.wxwidgets.org) to be installed.
Linux users should check for distribution provided packages, Windows users must compile wx themselves.
You should use at least the 2.6 branch of wx; nohttpd was developed with version 2.6.2 and 2.6.3.
For further notes please see the nohttpd homepage.

1. Compiling on Linux

In the nohttpd source directory type "make -f Makefile.linux". This produces the binary executable "nohttpd".
Copy this to a folder in $PATH like "/usr/bin".
Like already noted, nohttpd requires root privileges to run. It's advised to run nohttpd via sudo.
nohttpd was developed with the 4.0.x versions of gcc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Compiling on Windows

nohttpd comes with makefile templates for Visual C++ and MinGW. With either you need to edit the makefiles for
correct include and library paths.
If you want to use a different compiler just look up the needed includes and libraries in one of the two provied
makefiles for Windows.

2a. With Visual C++

Type "nmake -f Makefile.vc" in a dos console. This produces the binary executable "nohttpd.exe".
nohttpd was developed with version 7.1 of Visual C++.

2b. With MinGW

Type "mingw32-make -f Makefile.mingw" in a dos console. This produces the binary executable "nohttpd.exe".
nohttpd was developed with version 3.4.2 of MinGW.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Compiling on MacOS X

You need to have Apple's free Xcode development suite installed to compile nohttpd.
Type "make -f Makefile.mac" in a terminal. This produces the application package "nohttpd.app" in the source code
folder.
