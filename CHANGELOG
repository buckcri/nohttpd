
v2.1.0:

- Added: Statistics about the queries to nohttpd:
         You can see how many times a specific host was blocked and when the last block of this host occured.
         Furthermore you can watch details about any blocked host; these details consist of the access time, URL,
         user agent and referrer for one query. The number of queries in the detail view is configurable.

         Note: Enabling this feature costs some RAM and CPU time.

- Added: Query logging may now be done as fully query (i.e. the data as it was received) or as summary (i.e. condensed
         to the relevant parts).
         
         Note: Enabling logging costs some CPU time.

- Added: You may now delete all settings when uninstalling nohttpd under Windows.
         This means there won't be any traces of nohttpd left after uninstalling, not even registry keys.

- Added: Possibility to view the log messages in an external editor associated with .txt files.
         Please note that you have to delete the temporary file where the log's contents is saved to yourself.
         Done by request.

- Fixed: "Close to tray" is disabled/"No tray icon" is enabled if the tray icon wasn't installed successfully.
         The user would be unable to regain control over nohttpd if it was hidden without a clickable tray icon
         to show the window again.
         Note: Those settings are only used for the current session and not saved. On the next start nohttpd will
         attempt to install a tray icon again.

- Fixed: The nohttpd window is now brought to the front if the icon is double-clicked and the window is already shown, but
         hidden behind other windows.

- Changed: Log messages now display the date of the log event, too (they displayed just the time before).
           Done by request.
           
- Changed: Redesigned layout:
           - The main frame is resizable now.
           - Menu driven layout.
           - Options are in a seperate window now.

v2.0.1:

- Fixed: Possible crash when "Log queries" was enabled and the query contained "%" characters.
         This bug is considered critical and updating is strongly recommended.
         Also removed possible redundant query logging on failed connections.
         Thanks to Lennart for reporting this bug and testing the fix!

- Fixed: Small fixes to Makefile.vc and nohttpd2_private.rc (needed for compiling with MinGW), though these
         are only meant as templates for compiling.
